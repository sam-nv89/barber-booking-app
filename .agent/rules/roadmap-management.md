When modifying project plans (e.g., ROADMAP.md, FUTURE_PLANS.md):
1. NEVER delete past agreed milestones or history.
2. Mark completed items with [x] and completed tasks with ✅.
3. Mark cancelled items explicitly (e.g., using ~strikethrough~ or [Cancelled] tag), DO NOT delete them.
4. Append new tasks/phases to the end or appropriate section without erasing existing content.
